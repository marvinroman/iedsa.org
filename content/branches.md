# Branches & Regions

::vuetify-row

:::vuetify-col{.column-2}
Why the division? Covering such a large span of vibrant and distinct communities can lead to dissonant representation in our chapter. Promoting the creation of branches & regions facilitates better outreach, encourages local participation, and establishes open lines of communication in our Inland Empire communities. While regions are a little less formal, branches, as defined by our bylaws, are a subgroup of IE DSA. They consist of at least five members in good standing and may be defined by geography or language. The chair(s) of branches also hold membership on our Steering Committee. 

### Branches

IE DSA currently only has one branch, the Desert Branch and it is made of the communities of Palm Springs, Cathedral City, Palm Desert, Indian Wells, La Quinta, Indio, Coachella, Yucca Valley

Don't see your city? Let us know by emailing us at inlanddsa@gmail.com. No one should feel like they need to be exclusive to one region. Visit neighboring regions or branches and find out which one suits you.
