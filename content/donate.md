Help IE DSA build socialism locally! We are a political and activist organization that believes that working people should run both the economy and society democratically to meet human needs, not to make profits for a few. Donations will go towards administration fees, printed promotional and educational material, and merch (just to name a few). 

Inland Empire DSA is a 501c4 non-profit and donations are **not** tax deductible. Our EIN is 84-3628180.
