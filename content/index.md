## We are the [Inland Empire]{.text-primary} Chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America]{.text-primary}

:spacer

We cover both Riverside and San Bernardino counties.

Members of Inland Empire DSA (IE DSA) strive for collective liberation and economic participation through shared control of the means and resources of production. We are focused on building a base of mass power through electoral activism, political education, awareness-raising, direct action, and mutual aid.
