The objective of the Labor Working Group is to support to workers in the Inland Empire region. Our primary goal is on organizing workers across various industries, with a special emphasis on the essential logistics industry, in addition to providing support and guidance to workers who want to organize their workplaces. Our aim is to establish a strong alliance between DSA and labor unions in our community, fostering solidarity and collaboration. Through our efforts, we strive to create a more equitable and just working environment for all, which will build working-class power and help create the conditions for meaningful class struggle.
