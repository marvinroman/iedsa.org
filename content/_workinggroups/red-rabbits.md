The Red Rabbits Working Group focuses on the safety of our chapter's members and coalition partners. With an emphasis on Digital Information Security, Meeting Security, Protest Security and Medic Training the group works to seek out and coordinate security and safety training opportunities for chapter members to utilize what we learn in training to keep each other safe at DSA and coalition partner events, including meetings, protests, demonstrations, and other related chapter actions. The Working Group will serve as liaisons to the DSA national Red Rabbits group to coordinate security efforts.
