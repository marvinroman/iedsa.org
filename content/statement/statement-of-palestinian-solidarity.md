Inland Empire DSA stands in solidarity with the Palestinian people in Gaza and denounces the Israeli occupation as it committs genocide while the world watches.  

We demand that our elected officials in the United States government cease any form of aid to the violent settler colonial state of Israel.  

For over 75 years, the people of Palestine have been subjected to violence in the form of forced resettlement, Orwellian surveillance, military blockades, and intentionally cruel economic sanctions. This violence has been perpetrated by Israel with the support of other oppressive imperialist governments like that of the United States and the United Kingdom.  

Inland Empire DSA unapologetically believes that the Palestinian people, like all oppressed people, have a right to meet their own oppression with resistance and struggle. We place the blame for the decades of violence on the government of Israel. The United States, and its complicit allies, must also be held accountable for fully endorsing, enabling and encouraging these atrocities committed by Israel.  

Lastly, we call on our members and community to join local pro-Palestinian actions, if possible, donate to Palestinian mutual aid funds, share and/or post informational graphics on their social media platforms that promote support for the Palestinian struggle, and call their elected officials and demand an end to any aid to Israel. We must also deal with the hard truth that we ourselves are settlers on the rightful past, present, and future land of the Payómkawichum, Ɂívil̃uwenetem Meytémak, Yuhaaviatam/Maarenga’yam, Xawiƚƚ kwñchawaay, Fernandeño Tataviam, Tongva/Kizh, Nüwüwü, Quechan, Nuwuvi, Newe Sogobia, and Vanyumé territory. As complicit benefactors of settler colonialism we must recognize our duty to stand against any further attempts of colonization anywhere.

**More about IE DSA:** Inland Empire DSA is a political and activist organization, not a party. We welcome people of all backgrounds into our ranks to fight for a better world. We strive for collective liberation and economic participation through shared control of the means and resources of production and are focused on building a base of mass power through electoral activism, political education, awareness-raising, direct action, and mutual aid.
