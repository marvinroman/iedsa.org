On May 2, Redlands City Council voted against Resolution Number 8439 (Res. No.8439) which authorizes flying the Rainbow Pride Flag at Redland’s City Hall during the month of June. Despite the precedent of allowing the flag to fly over Redland’s City Hall for the past two years and the overwhelming show of pro-resolution support from the Redlands community, Mayor Eddie Tejeda and Councilmembers Mario Saucedo and Paul Barich knowingly ignored their constituents and voted against Res No. 8439.

The only support came from Councilmembers Jenna Guzman-Lowry and Denise Davis. They heard the words from those who spoke that night about the harassment that members of the LGBTQIAP2+ (LGBT+) community have faced. They listened as their constituents told them what the Rainbow Pride Flag represents to them. And, in solidarity with their community, Guzman-Lowry and Davis debunked legal and slippery slope fallacies presented by opponents of Res. No. 8439.

Members of Inland Empire DSA (IEDSA) recognize the decision of Redlands City Council as a concession to the chauvinist, christo-fascist activists that have been targeting the city and the country at large with the goal of erasing and eradicating members of the LGBT+ community. This strategy, which is aligned with the capitalist program of scapegoating marginalized identities in order to divide the working class, fuels our members’ continued commitment of organizing locally against fascism and capitalism across race, gender, sexuality and social differences. Councilmember Tejeda’s vote is particularly concerning, given his support of flying the flag at a March meeting of the Redlands City Council.

Therefore, IEDSA condemns Councilembers Tejeda, Saucedo and Barich’s blatant disregard for democracy and Tejeda’s pandering to outside extremists. As socialists, we know to expect this behavior from those aligned with the Republican Party. However, we are not surprised by the opposition vote to Res. No. 8439 from council members who are aligned with the Democratic Party. Again and again, at the national and local levels, Democrats, once elected, fail to uphold true democracy and fight injustice. Furthermore, IEDSA applauds Councilmember Guzman-Lowery, a comrade of IEDSA, and Councilmember Davis, a Democrat whose own queer identity is being targeted, for their support of Res. No. 8439. IEDSA has declared a necessary and inseparable solidarity with members of the LGBT+ community, and view their self-determination and empowerment as linked with our collective freedom. We will continue to promote true systematic change in Redlands and throughout the Inland Empire.
