The IEDSA Socialist Feminist working group consists of people of varying identities coming together for the downfall of patriarchy, which systematically oppresses people of all kinds and is instrumental in upholding capitalism by dividing the working class.

We recognize that in turn, capitalism is instrumental in upholding patriarchy, that the two forces are inseparable, and that the fight against both are connected and essential in liberating all working people.

We acknowledge that women and femmes face undue hardship and discrimination at the hands of sexism and misogyny which is rampant in our culture and foundational to patriarchal capitalism. Capitalism's reliance on, and perpetuation of, patriarchy permeates all social relations. We affirm that socialist political organizing and activism, including DSA on a national level and local level, are not immune to these harmful forces, and we are dedicated to combating patriarchal tendencies within our organization.

We formed out of the need to make our community a safe place for women and femmes and the desire to fight for a socialism that is both feminist and intersectional. Focuses of the SocFem Working Group include feminist literature and feminist theory, mutual aid, anticapitalist exchange, and the safeguarding of reproductive rights. In addition, we embrace and celebrate women and femmes, recognizing joy and pleasure as birthrights too often stripped by patriarchal capitalism. Our dedication to living in joyful revolution is practice for the socialist world we will win.
