IEDSA's Political Education Committee is responsible for the the educational development of Socialists in our chapter. To that end, we host monthly events, including Book Clubs, Socialist Night School Courses, discussions on current events, and Political Education Events at our General Meetings. This is a great place to get plugged in to the chapter, deepen your understanding of Socialist Principles, learn how to communicate with comrades more effectively, and, most importantly, learn how to turn our theory into praxis!

*Philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.* - Karl Marx
