The Ecosocialists Working Group mission is to ensure the transition to a safe and green future is based on sound ecological principles, preserving the viability of the natural and human environments for future generations and other forms of life, bearing in mind the historical and present inequities imposed by prior forms of society, and the working group hosts a committee pursuing public ownership and control of the Inland Empire's energy infrastructure. This working group seeks to help build local power for climate & environmental justice; advance an ecosocialist perspective in environmental justice movements, the DSA & greater left; promote understanding of climate science as well as the intersections of capitalism, imperialism, systemic oppression & climate crisis; prioritize labor solidarity and class struggle as workers; and build a socialist movement that reflects the needs of the people and limits of our planet.
