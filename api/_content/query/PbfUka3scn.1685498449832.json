Covering such a large span of vibrant and distinct communities can lead to dissonant representation in our chapter. Promoting the creation of branches & regions facilitates better outreach, encourages local participation, and establishes open lines of communication in our Inland Empire communities. While regions are a little less formal, branches, as defined by our bylaws, are a subgroup of IE DSA. They consist of at least five members in good standing and may be defined by geography or language.
